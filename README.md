About the Program:

This program doesn't need any command line inputs. I thought to keep it as simple as possible, while providing the robust functionality of RandomForest Classifier. This program build 10 decision tree models to use as a ensemble in RandomForest classifer. The program is tested with all 3 datasets provided.
